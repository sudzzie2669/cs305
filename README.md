Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial, a consulting company, focuses on providing individualized financial plans for clients, including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. The company wanted to modernize its operations by securing its public web interface, particularly in adding a file verification step for secure data communications using a checksum mechanism. They sought to address the risk of transmitting compromised or altered data, especially given the sensitive nature of financial information.
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
One thing I did well during the vulnerability assessment was identifying potential software security vulnerabilities and evaluating how they could impact the system’s security. It is crucial to code securely to protect sensitive data from breaches and cyberattacks, as vulnerabilities can expose both a company's reputation and its clients' sensitive financial information. Software security contributes to a company’s overall well-being by minimizing risks, building customer trust, and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.
Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
A particularly challenging aspect of the vulnerability assessment was performing static analysis and interpreting the results from the OWASP dependency checker to separate genuine vulnerabilities from false positives. However, this process was also helpful in understanding how dependencies can introduce risks into the system. I increased security by adding a cryptographic hash algorithm for checksum verification and implementing HTTPS to secure communications.
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
To assess vulnerabilities in the future, I would use both static and dynamic testing tools, such as OWASP’s dependency-checker and code analysis tools, to identify issues early. I would prioritize vulnerabilities based on their potential impact and apply appropriate mitigation techniques, such as encryption, secure coding practices, and regular security reviews.
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To ensure the code was functional and secure, I followed secure coding protocols and ran dependency checks to identify and resolve potential issues. After refactoring the code, I used static analysis tools to verify that no new vulnerabilities were introduced. I also used functional testing to ensure the system behaved as expected.
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
For future assignments, tools like OWASP Dependency Check and secure coding practices, such as implementing encryption and using strong cryptographic standards, will be valuable. These resources helped ensure both code quality and security.
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
If I were to show future employers an example from this project, I would highlight my vulnerability assessment report, secure coding practices, and the steps I took to mitigate security risks. These showcase my ability to address software vulnerabilities proactively and apply industry-standard security practices.
